# Tico-Tower
Responsive webpages, created with HTML5, CSS, jQuery and jQueryMobile.
See what the page looks like, when rendered (works best with Chrome): http://tinyurl.com/TicoTower.

<b>!HOX!
If the page doesn't show correctly and looks crappy, your browser may be preventing you from downloading "unprotected code", since it is using RawGit: https://rawgit.com/. 
Allow it from the address bar (on Chrome it's an image of shield with a red x) and the page shows as it should. Don't worry, it's completely safe! :) </b>
